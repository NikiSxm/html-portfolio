<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm an aspiring Software Developer from Sint Maarten. I spent a long time wondering what I wanted to do with my life and career.
 I've thought about being a vet assistant, medical technologist, graphic designer, or game designer.
 I was very set on being a game designer because of my love for games, and I eventually got into coding and
 decided on becoming a Software Developer.
